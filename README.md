# coreutils

Rust rewrite of GNU coreutils.

### Overview

This project aims to reimplement the Unix core utilities using Rust. The core utilities (coreutils) are essential command-line tools that are commonly used in Unix-like operating systems. Our goal is to create a set of these utilities with a focus on safety, performance, and idiomatic Rust code.


### TODO
The following core utilities are planned for future development:

- ls: List directory contents.
- cp: Copy files and directories.
- mv: Move or rename files and directories.
- rm: Remove files or directories.
- cat: Concatenate and display file content.
- grep: Search text using patterns.
- echo: Display a line of text.
- find: Search for files in a directory hierarchy.
- chmod: Change file modes or Access Control Lists.
- chcon: Change file security context.
- chgrp: Change file group ownership.
- chmod: Change file modes or Access Control Lists.
- chown: Change file owner and group.
- copy: Copy files and directories (alias for `cp`).
- cp: Copy files and directories.
- csplit: Split a file into sections based on context.
- date: Display or set the system date and time.
- dd: Convert and copy files.
- df: Report file system disk space usage.
- dircolors: Set up color support for `ls`.
- expr: Evaluate expressions.
- getlimits: Display system resource limits.
- join: Join lines of two files on a common field.
- mv: Move or rename files and directories.
- sort: Sort lines of text files.
- split: Split a file into pieces.
- stat: Display file or file system status.
- tail: Output the last part of files.
- uniq: Report or omit repeated lines.
- who: Display who is logged in.

.. and a lot more.
